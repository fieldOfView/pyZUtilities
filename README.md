zutilties
=========

Some helpful nodes for ZOCP networks, implemented in Python


zmultiplier
-----------

Multiplies an input by a factor. Useful when a node outputs a float between 0.0 and 1.0 but another node needs a number between 0 and 255


zcounter
--------

Counts and displays the number of signals received on its input (which can be anything) for debugging purposes
